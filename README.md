🚀 Overview
In Java, the String class is unique because it is immutable and benefits from a specialized memory area known as the String Constant Pool. This project demonstrates how to efficiently manipulate text, compare strings correctly, and use modern Java methods to process character data.

🧠 Key Concepts Covered
Immutability: Understanding why String objects cannot be changed and how this ensures thread safety.

Memory Efficiency: Differences between String Literals (Pool) and new String() (Heap).

Comparison Logic: Why we use .equals() for content and == for memory addresses.

Performance: When to switch from String to StringBuilder or StringBuffer for intensive loops.

Would you like me to add a section specifically explaining the difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer for your README?
